# car-registry-microservices

This is a microservices version of the `car-registry` project that I made **to practice** Spring Boot microservices development, using Spring Config, API Gateway, Eureka Service, Spring Security, and more. 

You can find a better microservices project that I finished recently called `task-manager-api` on my GitHub.
